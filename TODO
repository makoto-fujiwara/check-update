(TODO)
   - archivers/zutils  avoid picking 1.7-pre1
   - archivers/unalz now 0.65 -> found 0.23 (?)
   - leave older version of 00.Summary.html (by two weeks ?)
   - pkg_info is not always in PATH, for example execution from crontab
   - devel/adacurses defines (just one) DISTFILES = AdaCurses-${ACVERSION}.tgz, should pick it
   - github: if release page (ex: https://github.com/hughsie/appdata-tools/releases)
     it has priority
   - $SimplePattern logic is wrong, even after Automatic DISTBASE set $SimplePattern,
     it does not work, while adding @SimplePattern works (emulator/bochs)
   - help message (-h option) is inaccurate
     * -h output is too long
     * -V option works correctly ?
   - Version Issue
    *  benchmarks/bonnie++  1.03e > 1.03   ( flags as alphabetical suffix favorable ?)
    *  should provide debugging easily
  - Statistics count seems to have minor error, (0,0) is not correctly counted ?
  - honor (or utilize) the time stamp shown on directory if ftp listing
    * ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/
    * p5-Shell-Perl 0.009 > 0.07
  - Automatic Add 0, example: time/p5-DateTime-Format-ISO8601, PKGNAME= p5-${DISTNAME}00
  - Automatic @SimplePattern
  - no_release for github implemented,
    p5-App-Prove-Plugin-ProgressBar      OK
    p5-App-Prove-Plugin-ProgressBar-Each NG
  - Take care github stuff but no release, ex sysutils/rkflashtool
  - Man page missing 
  - make check-update-depends 
    (like make clean-depends, but not really inside of this developement)
  - individual package
    * pdf-parser_V0_3_9  0.3.9 -> ??
    * time/remind  3.1.15 -> 03.01.15
    * lang/py..-html-docs does not find upper numeric-name-folder (3.6.0 -> 3.6.1)
    * mail/elm DISTNAME is elm258 (no hyphen), should be automatically processed
    * (www/ruby-jquery-rails) pick 4.6.1 for jquery-rails (should be 4.2.2)
      when   "gem22 list -r -q jquery-rails" returns following lines
      jqgrid-jquery-rails (4.6.1)
      jquery-rails (4.2.2)
      ... (correceted now ?)
    * devel/bzr-gtk	bzr-gtk	0.100.0	->	0.9.0	0.103.0 (strange)
    * audio/mikmod picked 3.3.10 before but now 3.2.7
    * 0.32rc1 < 0.32 (cad/ghdl ghdl 0.32rc1 -> 0.32)
    * biology/cdhit 4.6.4 -> 454 EDITversion does not give any effect (?)
    * misc/goffice0{6,8} maybe on MaturedList (?)
    * graphics/clutter is upto date (1.22.2) but unable to find the version
    * (www/opera) seems up to date, but not pick up it.
    * editors/texmaker is upto date (as of 20150721)

    * databases/postgresql-postgis stays intentionally v1. don't flag please
    * geography/proj is also up to date
      (thanks gdt@)
    * sysutils/entr  no list by curl but list by wget (?)
    * audio/audacious-plugin, don't pick audacious-plugins-3.8-beta2.tar.bz2  (as 3.8.2)
    * (Special Master site for SF) sysutils/heirloom-basename 	heirloom-basename

  - If EMACS_TYPE=emacs26 (in /etc/mk.conf), 
     which is not ususally defined, in module.mk, some variables won't be defined. 
     Probably, nice to ignore /etc/mk.conf
  - MaturedList doesn't work with family, say, math/pari23 won't be disabled
  - Pick from http://beta.repology.org/package/
  - tk problem (versioned directory and family, I am afraid) 
  - 10/02/2016 results degraded on GNOME site, hint -> git diff  569021d 6815338 ,
    but possibly network condition ?
  - family find (external tool)
  - w3m result cache
  - limited-list mode: list set of packages and scan partially base on it
  - Mailing to the MAINTAINER
    Difference is firm (confident) and the receiver wants, mail report
    on every Friday or on the update (?)
  - (DISTBASE)
    * Introduce DISTPATTERN or DISTREGEXP (Regular Expression for DISTBASE + VERSION)
    * shuffle words to find DISTBASE
       (for example, lang/py27-html-docs:)
       VERS=      2.7.13
       DISTNAME=  python-${VERS}-docs-html
       PKGNAME=   py27-html-docs-${VERS}
    *  py-expect: DISTNAME= ExpectPy-1.9b1 -> 1.8.3 (reversed)
    * (GetDistBase issue), See DISTBASE file
       ---------------------------------
          grep ^sub check-update|grep -i distbase
              (manually removed for prototype)

       ---------------------------------
  - If VERSION is written in Makefile.common, share it and skip the referer (py-objc-*)
  - Take care github stuff but no release, ex sysutils/rkflashtool
  - Alpha version or Develop branch / unstable version
    Don't pick alpha version of devel/rdp
    perl (with odd number version or _xx for Perl module)
    dbus
    gnome stuff
    gstreamer and gst-plugins* (part of gnome...)
    fontconfig
    lilypond
    poppler* (gnome)
    rdiff-backup
    webkit (gnome)
    (Thanks Thomas wiz@)
    audacious 3.7 is not release, but alpha or beta
    (99 or 90) may be development version and nice not to list gdt@
  - Issue for */*-devel package. Some 53 are listed now  
  
  -  (done) Avoid to show 1.[odd number].x for sysutils/dbus. It is unstable branch
  - filesystems/fuse-ntfs-3g	fuse-ntfs-3g	2014.2.15 ->0.0	32015.3.14
  - diff links in devel? need to be adjusted
  - MaturedList path is not good for standalone execution
  
  - sentinel (watch timeout of curl process)
    misc/py-stdnum
  - Taking care math/R-* package

   * If the (last) argument, say @ARGV has shape categery/package
    take it as it is.

    * decide the only one final status for each package (for (0.0) case)  and then collect the Stats

    *  ----- By package status  -----
      Get status for MASTER_SITE (MasterSiteStatus) .. for listing,        
      Get status for HOMEPAGE    (HomePageStatus)   .. for listing,        
      Get status for Package     (PackageStatus)    .. Stats will look for this

    *  ----- For Stats -----
    DNS Refused 550 500  403 404 301 302 200 found
    * %STATS{'200'} %STATS{'403'} %STATS{'404'} %STATS{'500'} %STATS{'550'} etc
      Use the 3rd value of above listed (by package)
      $STATS{$PackagStatus}++;
       (MASTER_SITE, HOMEPAGE, PATTERN problem = site was found but not find the string)

    * Customized list. Every developer can check his/her own list
      or -M maintainer option 
    * Two level candidates
         1. MASTER_SITES + HOMEPAGE
         2. versions 
    * Algorithm
         Time stamp
         unzip60 > unzip552
         Add list of three-digits, they will be translated 60 -> 6.0 552 -> 5.5.2
    * category mode, -C -> all categories with -c -f -S category.html
    * Catetory mode (output is by category name for whole tree)
    * Exclude wip in the list, but add wip column
    * check the version at wip
    * log by classification (say PROBLEM.log etc)
    * sub main ()
    * if the new version > 10, dont make it the number as regular #
    (done ?) * Stats is not correct (especially 0.0)
    (stats)
    * add 403 for stats.
      Is this missing in the stats ?
    * Utilize PKGNAME= line in Makefile for evaluating version number (?)
      (like adding 00 for the name)
    * Disable DISTBASE_CACHE (for debug ?)

(BAD case)
