(TODO)
  - ruby-needle (and succeeding packages) get (0.0). Individual exec OK. ruby-ncurses
    affects (?)
  - devel/bzr-gtk	bzr-gtk	0.100.0	->	0.9.0	0.103.0 (strange)
  - audio/mikmod picked 3.3.10 before but now 3.2.7
  - tk problem (versioned directory and family, I am afraid) 
  - 10/02/2016 results degraded on GNOME site, hint -> git diff  569021d 6815338 ,
    but possibly network condition ?
  - family find (external tool)
  - w3m result cache
  - limited-list mode: list set of packages and scan partially base on it

  - Individual (single or partial) execution finds following, but -c devel won't  (devel/ruby-needle)
    ruby23- =>        (needle) (4321 ) Now:    1.3.0 ->   1.3.0 Todo:       
  - 0.32rc1 < 0.32 (cad/ghdl ghdl 0.32rc1 -> 0.32)
  - graphics/djview4
      ->  https://sourceforge.net/projects/djvu/files/DjView/4.10/ (mixed uplow case)
  - Mailing to the MAINTAINER
    Difference is firm (confident) and the receiver wants, mail report
    on every Friday or on the update (?)
  - Introduce DISTPATTERN or DISTREGEXP (Regular Expression for DISTBASE + VERSION)
  - Stablize gnome
  - If VERSION is written in Makefile.common, share it and skip the referer (py-objc-*)
  - Stablize sourceforge (and gnome)
  - Take care github stuff but no release, ex sysutils/rkflashtool
  - Develop branch is not good to appear in the table (with odd number version or _xx for Perl module)
    perl
    dbus
    gnome stuff
    gstreamer and gst-plugins* (part of gnome...)
    fontconfig
    lilypond
    poppler* (gnome)
    rdiff-backup
    webkit (gnome)
    (Thanks Thomas wiz@)

  - (alpha)  audacious 3.7 is not release, but alpha or beta
  - (99 or 90) may be development version and nice not to list gdt@
  -  biology/cdhit 4.6.4 -> 454 EDITversion does not give any effect (?)
  -  (done) Avoid to show 1.[odd number].x for sysutils/dbus. It is unstable branch
  - (www/opera) seems up to date, but not pick up it.
  - filesystems/fuse-ntfs-3g	fuse-ntfs-3g	2014.2.15 ->0.0	32015.3.14
  - diff links in devel? need to be adjusted
  - misc/goffice0{6,8} maybe on MaturedList (?)
  - graphics/clutter is upto date (1.22.2) but unable to find the version
  - MaturedList path is not good for standalone execution
  - editors/texmaker is upto date (as of 20150721)
  - databases/postgresql-postgis stays intentionally v1. don't flag please
  - devel/fann is actually up to date.  source tarball has a goofy name
  - geography/proj is also up to date
    (thanks gdt@)
  - sysutils/entr  no list by curl but list by wget (?)
  
  - Issue for */*-devel package. Some 53 are listed now
  - sentinel (watch timeout of curl process)
    misc/py-stdnum
  - Taking care math/R-* package
  - README.md
     * Prerequisite
     * setup
     * first trial
     * tuning
     * debugging
     * FAQ

  - If no argument, take current directory as category/package
    (In that case, no html output will generated)

   * If the (last) argument, say @ARGV has shape categery/package
    take it as it is.

    * decide the only one final status for each package (for (0.0) case)  and then collect the Stats

    *  ----- By package status  -----
      Get status for MASTER_SITE (MasterSiteStatus) .. for listing,        
      Get status for HOMEPAGE    (HomePageStatus)   .. for listing,        
      Get status for Package     (PackageStatus)    .. Stats will look for this

    *  ----- For Stats -----
    DNS Refused 550 500  403 404 301 302 200 found
    * %STATS{'200'} %STATS{'403'} %STATS{'404'} %STATS{'500'} %STATS{'550'} etc
      Use the 3rd value of above listed (by package)
      $STATS{$PackagStatus}++;
       (MASTER_SITE, HOMEPAGE, PATTERN problem = site was found but not find the string)

    * (Special Master site for SF) sysutils/heirloom-basename 	heirloom-basename
    * Customized list. Every developer can check his/her own list
      or -M maintainer option 
    * Two level candidates
         1. MASTER_SITES + HOMEPAGE
         2. versions 
    * Algorithm
         Time stamp
         unzip60 > unzip552
         Add list of three-digits, they will be translated 60 -> 6.0 552 -> 5.5.2
    * category mode, -C -> all categories with -c -f -S category.html
    * Catetory mode (output is by category name for whole tree)
    * Exclude wip in the list, but add wip column
    * check the version at wip
    * If the directory (of MASTER_SITES) contains pure digit element
      say, /0.5/ etc, check upper directory
    * log by classification (say PROBLEM.log etc)
    * sub main ()
    * if the new version > 10, dont make it the number as regular #
    (done ?) * Stats is not correct (especially 0.0)
    (stats)
    * add 403 for stats.
      Is this missing in the stats ?
    * Utilize PKGNAME= line in Makefile for evaluating version number (?)
      (like adding 00 for the name)
    * Disable DISTBASE_CACHE (for debug ?)

(BAD case)
